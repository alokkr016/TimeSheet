Timesheets are a vital tool for any organization that wants to keep track of its employees' time and productivity. They allow managers to see how much time each employee is spending on different tasks, which can help with scheduling and resource allocation. 

In addition to being useful for management purposes, timesheets can also be used as a way for employees to track their own progress and manage their workload. By keeping track of the time they spend on each task, employees can identify areas where they may need to improve their efficiency or ask for additional support.
